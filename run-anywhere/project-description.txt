Goal:-

The goal of this exercise is to create a shell script that executes a given command on multiple
servers.

Scenario:-

The number of systems you manage is growing and you need a way to quickly execute the exact
same command on all of your systems. Because it takes too much of your time to type the same
command on every single system you manage, you decide to write a script that will do this for you.

Pseudocode :-

# List of servers from file. This can be hosts file or any file having server I/P addresses.

# Make sure that script not executed with root.

# Make sure the user provides the file argument.

# Initialize command variable.

# Loop through SERVER_LIST.
