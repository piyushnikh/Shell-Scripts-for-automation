Goal:-

The goal of this exercise is to create a shell script that executes a given command or a script on multiple servers.

Scenario:-

The number of systems you manage is growing and you need a way to quickly execute the exact same command on all of your systems. Because it takes too much of your time to type the same command/script on every single system you manage, you decide to write a script that will do this for you.

Pseudocode :-

# List of servers IP addresses in a form of an array in the script.

# Make sure that script not executed with root.

# Make sure the user provides the file argument.

# Use FOR Loop to navigate through the server IP addreses and then execute command or script.
