Goal :-

To take backup of application logs from one primary server to remote server in an incremental order.

Problem Statement :-

As users & traffic grows in our applications it becomes very important for us to manage the application level logs & take their backups. I faced a similar situation while working in
a client environment where incremental backup was to be taken.

Solution :-

Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for both remote and local files. It uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method for bringing 
remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of files are present at one of the ends of the 
link beforehand.

Pre-requisistes :-

1) Installed the rsync offocial package over the local & destination server. Check out documentation to install in RHEL,

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/chap-managing_confined_services-rsync

2) Achieved passwordless authentication between source & destination servers.

3) Need to make sure that the destination server has the directory with correct permissions and owner setup.
