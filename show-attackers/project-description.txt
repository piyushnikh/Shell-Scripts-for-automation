################Scenario#####################

One day, you received a call about a user being locked out of their account.  
Being the awesome sysadmin that you are, you decided to look at the log files to see why this person's account was locked.  
While doing so, you happened to notice thousands of failed login attempts!

You decide you need a way to quickly summarize the failed login attempts. That way, you can quickly decide if an IP address needs to blocked.

#################Shell Script Requirements################

You think about what the shell script must do and how you would like it to operate.  You come up with the following list.

The script:

1) Is named "show-attackers.sh".

2) Requires that a file is provided as an argument.  
If a file is not provided, or it cannot be read, then the script will display an error message and exit with a status of 1.

3) Counts the number of failed login attempts by IP address.  
If there are any IP addresses with more than 10 failed login attempts, the number of attempts made, the IP address, and the location will be displayed.

Hint: use the geoiplookup command to find the location of the IP address.

##################Pseudocode###################

You can use the following pseudocode to help you with the logic and flow of your script.

# Make sure a file was supplied as an argument.

# Display the CSV header.

# Loop through the list of failed attempts and corresponding IP addresses.

# If the number of failed attempts is greater than the limit, display count, IP, and location.

################Geolookup Tool installation###################

To install geoiplookup tool on Ubuntu instance use the below command,
