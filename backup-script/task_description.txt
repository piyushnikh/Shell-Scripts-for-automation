Task Description

In one of my previous assignments, I worked on a scenario where the application logs continuously populating on server directory and consuming more space.

Under application SME's guidance, I proposed a solution by writing a script to make archive of older log files and moving to another location.

There are two scripts which I have written here,

1) First script is just a sample script which creates .log files in directory for demonstration purposes.

2) Second script is the real script implemented which will make a archive, move archived file to a location & corresponding older logs will be deleted.

In this way, we can achieve to take backup of older files and can use older log files if required.
